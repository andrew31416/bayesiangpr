# Gaussian process regression with posterior distributions

This is an implementation of univariate Gaussian process gression, where the posterior distribution for latent variables in a radial basis function kernel are inferred using reparameterization gradient variational inference. For a more informative description, please see the jupyter notebook [README](https://github.com/andrew31416/bayesiangpr/blob/master/examples/example_1.ipynb).
